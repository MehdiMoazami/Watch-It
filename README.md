# Watch-It-Discribtion

An android app written for wearOs and android watches 
this app is written in kotlin language and uses google map API from google cloud platform services . 

After covid qurantine time when we started to have classes in person again i started a new habbit of biking to university for my classes and this inspired me to write a GPS app for android watch so i could check the map in a more convinient and accessible way. this app helped me to be more focus on the bike ride by checking the map on my wrist rather than using my phone .
